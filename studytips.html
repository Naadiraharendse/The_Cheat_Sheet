                There's a little chance that studying with friends will help your process of memorising things.
                 Their progress might put you off and make you lose motivation. Make sure that your cellphone
                 is not easily  accessible when you are studying, as it can distract you. Ensure you're in an
                 environment that best suits your needs, for example study where there are not too many people.</p>

                 <li><b><font color='green'>Use your learning skills for memorisation</font color='green'></b></li>
                  Everyone has different learning styles, and can use this to their advantage. Don't use methods that work for
                  other peeople, use trial and error methods and see what works for you. This can involve reading and wirting notes,
                  listening to audios of notes or drawing flow charts in order to memorise your material.</p>

                 <li><b><font color='green'>Set deadlines</font color='green'></b></li>
                 <p>When you dont have time limits, you tend to procrastinate and put your studying off. This is bad
                   and can affect productivity. Break up your work by maybe doing two hours everyday. You will fall
                   into this routine and productivity will rapidly increase. Reward youself after each session!</p>

                 <li><b><font color='green'>Don't stress too much</font color='green'></b></li>
                 <p>Everytime you feel anxious or de-motivated think about what will happen if you pass/fail a test.
                    Stressing too much can make you so nervous that may make you forget things (maybe as much as I have). This
                    doesnt mean that you shouldn't care, it just means that you shouldn't stress <i>too much</i>.</p>

                  <li><b><font color='green'>Eat healthy and exercise</font color='green'></b></li>
                  <p>By eating healthy and being involved in physical activity, your cognitive performance will increase
                     as your stress levels will decrease too. This basically means that the more active you are, the better
                     your memory and thinking skills can be.</p>

                  <li><b><font color='green'>Get difficult things out of the way first</font color='green'></b></li>
                  <p>This is a good strategy as getting challenging things over will make everything
                      else seem easier. Everything that comes after that will go much quicker and will
                      give you more time to relax!</p>

                  <li><b><font color='green'>Stay organised</font color='green'></b></li>
                  <p>You cannot do work when you don't know what has to be in and when. This can cost you alot
                    of time that has been wasted. Use a planner to keep track of assigment due dates. This way
                    you always take things in on time, and also time won't be wasted, that could have been used for better things.</p>

                    <li><b><font color='green'>Understand topics in your own words</font color='green'></b></p>
                    <p>The key to help improve your memory is by unerstanding topics in your own words. If you don't understand something
                    in your own words, you ae more likely to forget that information.</p>

                    <li><b><font color='green'>Quiz yorself</font color='green'></b></li>
                    <p>When you do this, you obtain a greater understanding and knowledge of the work. You get to
                      imagine what tests would be like and this can help you improve! Create your own tests and
                      make flashcards.</p>

                    <li><b><font color='green'>Motivation is important</font color='green'></b></li>
                    <p>Don't find excuses not to study. Remeber, you are working towards your future and a successfull one at
                      that! It's important to always stay motivated, and when you don't, think about where you want to be in the future!</p>
